#  Mood Tracker Music App
Overview
The Mood Tracker Music App allows users to select their current mood and receive a curated list of music tracks tailored to that mood. The app fetches music from an external API based on the user’s input and provides basic playback functionality. It’s designed to be simple, intuitive, and visually appealing, leveraging a mobile-first approach with React Native and Expo.
Key Features
1. Mood Selection
Description: Users choose their mood from a predefined list, which serves as the input for music recommendations.
Core Component: MoodSelector
Displays a set of mood options (e.g., "Happy," "Sad," "Calm," "Energetic") as interactive buttons.
Triggers an action to fetch music when a mood is selected.
User Flow: 
User taps a mood button on the home screen.
The app navigates to a music screen with relevant tracks.
2. Music Fetching
Description: The app retrieves music tracks from an external API based on the selected mood.
Core Service: musicApi
Handles API requests to fetch music data (e.g., track names, artists, and audio URLs).
Maps moods to API parameters (e.g., "Happy" might fetch upbeat tracks).
User Flow:
After mood selection, the app sends a request to the music API.
Retrieved tracks are passed to the music screen for display.
3. Music Display and Playback
Description: Users view a list of fetched tracks and can play them directly in the app.
Core Components:
MusicScreen: Displays the list of tracks associated with the selected mood.
MusicPlayer: Provides basic audio playback controls (play/pause).
User Flow:
On the music screen, users see a list of track names.
Tapping a "Play" button next to a track streams the audio using the device’s speakers.
4. Navigation
Description: Seamless movement between the home screen (mood selection) and music screen (track display/playback).
Core Mechanism: Expo Router
File-based routing maps app/index.tsx to the home screen and app/music.tsx to the music screen.
Passes the selected mood as a parameter between screens.
User Flow:
Start on the home screen → Select mood → Navigate to music screen → Return to home screen if desired.
Technical Components
MoodSelector (src/components/MoodSelector.tsx):
Input: A callback function (onSelectMood) to handle mood selection.
Output: Renders mood buttons styled with NativeWind; triggers navigation with the selected mood.
Behavior: Static list of moods (expandable via config); each button is tappable.
musicApi (src/services/musicApi.ts):
Input: A mood string (e.g., "Happy").
Output: A promise resolving to an array of track objects (e.g., { id, name, artist, uri }).
Behavior: Makes an HTTP request to a music API (e.g., Spotify, SoundCloud, or mock service); handles errors gracefully.
MusicScreen (app/music.tsx):
Input: Mood parameter from navigation (via useLocalSearchParams).
Output: Renders a list of tracks fetched from musicApi.
Behavior: Fetches tracks on mount or mood change; integrates with MusicPlayer for playback.
MusicPlayer (src/components/MusicPlayer.tsx):
Input: A track URI (audio source URL).
Output: A play button and audio playback functionality.
Behavior: Uses expo-av to load and play audio; unloads audio when component unmounts to prevent memory leaks.
Navigation (app/_layout.tsx):
Input: None (configures app-wide routing).
Output: A stack navigator with home and music screens.
Behavior: Manages screen transitions and header options (e.g., titles).
Data Flow
User opens the app and lands on the home screen (app/index.tsx).
User selects a mood via MoodSelector.
The app navigates to MusicScreen (app/music.tsx), passing the mood as a parameter.
MusicScreen calls fetchMusicByMood from musicApi with the mood.
API returns track data, which MusicScreen renders as a list.
User taps "Play" on a track, triggering MusicPlayer to stream the audio.
Assumptions and Constraints
Mood Options: Limited to a small, predefined set for simplicity (e.g., 4-6 moods).
Music Source: Requires an external API with mood-based filtering (e.g., Spotify’s playlist or genre endpoints). A mock API can substitute for initial development.
Playback: Basic play functionality; no advanced controls (e.g., seek, volume) in the core MVP.
Offline Mode: Not supported in the core version; assumes internet connectivity.
Styling: Relies on NativeWind for Tailwind CSS-like simplicity; minimal custom CSS.
Extensibility
Mood Expansion: Add more moods or dynamic mood detection (e.g., via user input or sensors).
Music Sources: Integrate multiple APIs or a custom backend.
Playback Features: Add pause, stop, or playlist queuing.
Storage: Persist mood history or favorite tracks using AsyncStorage.
Example User Scenario
User: Opens the app feeling "Calm."
Action: Taps the "Calm" button on the home screen.
Result: Navigates to the music screen, sees tracks like "Chill Lo-Fi Beats," taps "Play," and hears relaxing music.
